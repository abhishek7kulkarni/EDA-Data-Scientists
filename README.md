# Mathematica Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on 'Data Scientists'
A big picture view of the state of data scientists and machine learning engineers.

In this Mathematica project, we will explore the capabilities of Mathematica to better understand the state of data science enthusiasts. The dataset consisting of more than 10,000 rows is obtained from Kaggle, which is a result of 'Kaggle Survey 2017'. We will explore various capabilities of Mathematica in Data Analysis and Data Visualizations. Further, we will utilize Machine Learning techniques to train models and Classify features with several algorithms, such as k Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest.
